I'm an experienced software developer with a preference for backend technologies.
Currently I work in a back end focused role, though still occasionally dabble in front end components.
My professional experience is centred on C\# and .Net, and use of Microsoft SQL Server.
I have experience using Azure to host applications, both Azure Function and App Services.
I also have experience creating, adapting, and improving CI/CD pipelines to streamline development and deployment processes.
