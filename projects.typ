== Personal Projects

=== ProcVis _(TypeScript; HTML; Sass)_
#link("https://www.benjft.uk/ProcVis")[`benjft.uk/ProcVis`] #linebreak()
A web app to teach computer architecture.
- Designed and implemented an emulator for a Von Neumann processor.
- Created a simple instruction set for programming the processor.
- Emulated the processor entirely in the browser with a user interface.
- Visualised the internal processes of the processor.
- Aimed to make computer architecture learning interactive and intuitive.
- *Skills:* UI/UX Design, Educational Technology

=== Locksley _(C\#; .Net MAUI; Go)_
A mobile app for tracking personal scores, handicaps, and grouping statistics 
in archery.
- Features both a client app and an API.
- Can be used to organise tournaments and shares scores/challenges.
- *Skills:* API Development, Mobile Development, Data Management

=== ScanSolver _(Python)_
A tool designed to find optimal (fastest) orbits for ground scanning satellites 
in Kerbal Space Program.
- Implemented a numerical method to search for valid solutions.
- Efficiently homed in on solutions as the problem was not fully solvable algebraically.
- *Skills:* Algorithm Development, Simulation, Optimization Techniques

=== GreenFinger _(C++; Arduino)_
CovHack 2021 submission, won 1st place.
- Greenhouse automation robot that monitors soil moisture levels and waters plants as needed.
- Configurable through a locally broadcasted website.
- Allows different zones to have varying thresholds set up easily.
- Displays a history of statistics (temperature, water levels, etc.).
- *Skills:* IoT (Internet of Things), Web Development, Data Logging and Analysis

=== DLA-SimTool _(Go)_
A tool written to study lattice bound diffusion limited aggregation (DLA).
- Used monte-carlo techniques to simulate DLA.
- Characterised the properties of the resulting cluster.
- Studied higher dimensional aggregates.
- Analyzed how the fractal properties of the structure change with dimensionality.
- *Skills:* Statistical Analysis, Scientific Computing

=== ActiveMatterTool _(Java)_
A tool to analyze the behaviour of "soft active matter" through simulation.
- Used monte-carlo techniques to simulate a tiled section of space.
- Captured behavioural changes in the simulated active matter as particle density increases.
- *Skills:* Physics Simulation, Computational Physics
